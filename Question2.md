When I was 17, I discovered the value of taking consistent action by creating a company that was helping a whole region in Ukraine overcome electricity outages using devices generating electricity from solar energy. I started with homemade prototypes that took me and my friend a week to assemble and finished with a small production facility making 10 solar generators a day. These generators helped thousands of families stay warm, cook food, and do homework during cold winter. Our devices saved lives during surgeries because they were installed in hospitals and fire departments. 


When I was 18, I realized how teamwork can be used to scale impact. I joined Ukraine Global Scholars - a competitive non-profit organization helping talented Ukrainians get an education in the US. I first went through the program and then volunteered to help younger applicants. Having a small team and zero funding, we were able to secure millions of dollars in grants for education for Ukrainians who will later come back to help develop Ukraine. 


When I will be 22, I’ll graduate from Minerva University. I will have studied in 7 different countries and completed internships with local companies in 4. Because of my initial step into the unknown world of starting a company, I understood the importance of small actions that lead to disproportionately great achievements. I can’t wait to apply this approach to working with the best teams on groundbreaking technologies to solve the world's most urgent problems. Hopefully, as a Kleiner Perkins fellow.
