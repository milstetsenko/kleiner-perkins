## What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

##### Word Count: 246

I don’t know yet what exactly I want to do with my life. There are so many products that are incredibly exciting and it is hard to narrow down to one field, not having tried out many. What is guiding me is the number of people’s lives that I want to make safer, happier, and healthier. And the most straightforward way to do so for me is to provide opportunities and encourage people to solve problems on their own.


The current world doesn’t accept any failure, halting all potential innovations that don’t succeed immediately. You see a post on TechCrunch about Company X raising 200M, yet you never see them burning through cash and closing 6 months later. You see hundreds of “I am happy to announce” LinkedIn messages, but don’t see hundreds of rejections they went through. You see perfectly curated images on social media, but don’t know what happens behind the screen. These signals teach us to expect immediate results, leading to giving up unless succeeding early.


I want to change this stale surface of perfection that prevents us from amazing inventions that didn’t happen because we weren’t “smart”, “fast”, or “successful” enough. These changes of mindset can start in sustainability-related problems, incubators, and traditional institutions – depending on where I gain expertise to make changes. These changes will raise confident people willing to work hard and long, not expecting immediate perfection. This will magnify the great things that will follow after we push through.
