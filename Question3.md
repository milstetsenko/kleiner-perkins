## What is a product that does not yet exist but should?

An easy-to-implement and scalable product that would save many lives is to create a system for planning evacuations of people. 


It would be a real-time app that would distribute directions to different groups of people in order to maintain optimal load on the transport infrastructure. It is not difficult to implement and would only require three consistent components no matter the location, country, or type of emergency: transport availability in a certain region, identified shelters for incoming people, and the governmentâ€™s digital infrastructure. By using this product, governments would save billions of dollars spent on ad-hoc solutions as a response to the disaster. Thus, many systems would adopt a solution like this to manage catastrophic situations better. 


It would save thousands of lives lost during hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters that started happening in the US, and Pakistan due to climate change. It would also be hugely important for Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, or any other country where civilians are trapped in active combat zones and unable to escape safely.


Future improvements would include real-time redistribution of routes based on the busyness of the roads and new circumstances and the development of a rescue drone system that could evacuate civilians from especially hard-to-reach areas. Furthermore, we would include additional survival information, an opportunity to send SOS requests for rescue, and an opportunity for the people to log new information from what is happening around them to have the safest routing.
